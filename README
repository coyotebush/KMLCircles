SYNOPSIS
    kmlcircles [-a alpha] [-c color] [-r radius] -o outfile [infile...]

    containing circles surrounding the waypoints at a specified distance.

OPTIONS
    -o outfile
        KML filename to write to.

        Alpha value for the circle fill, expressed as two hexadecimal digits
        from 00 (transparent) to ff (opaque). Default: 99.

    -c color
        Color for the circle fill and border, expressed in RGB using 6
        hexadecimal digits. Default: ff0000 (red).

    -r radius
        Radius for the circles, in miles. Default: 0.1.

    CSV format is expected to contain each waypoint on a line with commas
    separating the latitude, longitude, and name, in that order. Latitude
    and longitude are expected to be in decimal degree format.
